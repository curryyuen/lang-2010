This proposal will aim to address the decreased in the crop yield production in the hail affecting country. Hail cause the falling of ice pellet that damage the vegetation. In 8 May 2017,  baseball-sized stones pummeled the west Denver Metro area, resulting in extensive damage to homes, windows, vehicles (many of which were in the late day commute), and roofs causing up to 1.4 billion dollars in damage. There are possible solution to tackle hail. Solution such as hail cannon can generate shock wave that can disrupt the formation of large hailstone. Also, for prevention, possible area that can be affected by hail can disperse cloud seeding chemical to increase precipation but suppressing the hail formation.
